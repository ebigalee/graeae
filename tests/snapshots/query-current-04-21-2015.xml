        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[One of Us opens with a girl running for her life. She and her friends are being stalked, hunted by a young man in a police officer's uniform on the small Norwegian island of Utøya. They lie down in the woods, pretending they're dead, hoping the man will see them and move on. He doesn't. He shoots the girl in the head, shoots her friends in their heads, point blank, execution-style. In search of new victims, the man moves on. But almost four years after that July day when 77 people, many of them children, were slain in cold blood, the nation of Norway still struggles to move on.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[The man, of course, was Anders Breivik, the homegrown Norwegian terrorist who shocked the world with his 2011 massacre in Oslo and Utøya. A far-right opponent of immigration, "cultural Marxism," and feminism, Breivik killed eight people with a bomb in Norway's capital before fatally shooting 69 at a summer camp sponsored by the country's Labor Party. In her new book One of Us, Norwegian journalist Åsne Seierstad recounts Breivik's evolution from a troubled child to a wannabe teenage tagger to, as he would later brag to a lawyer, "the biggest monster in Norwegian history since [Fascist politician and Nazi collaborator Vidkun] Quisling."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA[Breivik's childhood was a sad one. He was raised chiefly by his mother, who seemed depressed and unstable, and who resented him as a young child, finding him "clingy, whining ... [m]oody and violent." He showed early signs of psychopathy, including cruelty to animals; his neighbors forbade their children from associating with him, especially when pets were involved. As a teenager, he developed an obsession with tagging — graffiti — hoping to become one of Oslo's preeminent practitioners of the street art. But even after a series of arrests, he was still regarded as a "toy," a wannabe: "He was behaving like a king, but he was only a toy."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Breivik's obsession with Fascism, and his growing hatred of women and immigrants, especially Muslim ones, came slowly, although with obviously disastrous results. He locked himself in his room for years playing World of Warcraft, isolating himself from his friends, before becoming enchanted with the writings of several right-wing authors who warned that Europe was at risk of being ruled by Islamic law. He fantasized about bombing a journalists' convention, about attacking the Labor party congress with a flamethrower. Soon, he'd acquire firearms and bomb-making materiel. The rest, of course, is tragic, unspeakable history.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[Seierstad's recounting of the massacre is one of the most difficult things imaginable to read. By the time Breivik makes his way to Utøya, the reader has learned about the lives of many of the children on the island — some from the idyllic towns of northern Norway, some children of an immigrant family who escaped war-torn Kurdistan to make a new life for themselves. The descriptions of the murders are vivid, sickening, and heartbreaking.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[Seierstad does an incredible job telling the whole story of the massacre and its aftermath, the deeply flawed response by law enforcement, and the families who lost children. Her writing, translated into English by Sarah Death, is both straightforward and compassionate. She doesn't spare the reader's feelings; it's a deeply painful book to experience.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="7"><![CDATA[And that's the point, of course. The question the world asked after the Norway massacre, as it does after every one of these, was "Why?" What happened to Breivik to make him do this? The urge to demand an explanation is a natural one. One of Us does not provide one, because there isn't one. Breivik, like so many of his fellow terrorists and murderers, is beyond explaining. It's a difficult conclusion to reach, but, as Seierstad knows, it's often a necessary one.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="8"><![CDATA[One of Us is a masterpiece of journalism, a deeply painful chronicle of an inexplicable and horrifying attack that we'll likely never understand. It ends where it has to — with families still struggling to pick up the pieces of their lives. And with Breivik, in jail, pathetic and broken and whining about the justice system that put him away. In the end, it's the victims and their families that Seierstad cares about; they're the ones we'll remember, who we'll keep with us. Breivik, who wanted nothing more than for the world to know his name, becomes a footnote in his own story, a sad man who wanted to change the world, but instead strengthened the resolve of the people he terrorized — the least memorable character in this chapter of history, and in this brilliant, unforgettable book.

   <p><em>One of Us</em> opens with a girl running for her life. She and her friends are being stalked, hunted by a young man in a police officer's uniform on the small Norwegian island of Utøya. They lie down in the woods, pretending they're dead, hoping the man will see them and move on. He doesn't. He shoots the girl in the head, shoots her friends in their heads, point blank, execution-style. In search of new victims, the man moves on. But almost four years after that July day when 77 people, many of them children, were slain in cold blood, the nation of Norway still struggles to move on.</p>   <p>The man, of course, was Anders Breivik, the homegrown Norwegian terrorist who shocked the world with his 2011 massacre in Oslo and Utøya. A far-right opponent of immigration, "cultural Marxism," and feminism, Breivik killed eight people with a bomb in Norway's capital before fatally shooting 69 at a summer camp sponsored by the country's Labor Party. In her new book <em>One of Us</em>, Norwegian journalist Åsne Seierstad recounts Breivik's evolution from a troubled child to a wannabe teenage tagger to, as he would later brag to a lawyer, "the biggest monster in Norwegian history since [Fascist politician and Nazi collaborator Vidkun] Quisling."</p>   <p>Breivik's childhood was a sad one. He was raised chiefly by his mother, who seemed depressed and unstable, and who resented him as a young child, finding him "clingy, whining ... [m]oody and violent." He showed early signs of psychopathy, including cruelty to animals; his neighbors forbade their children from associating with him, especially when pets were involved. As a teenager, he developed an obsession with tagging — graffiti — hoping to become one of Oslo's preeminent practitioners of the street art. But even after a series of arrests, he was still regarded as a "toy," a wannabe: "He was behaving like a king, but he was only a toy."</p>   <p>Breivik's obsession with Fascism, and his growing hatred of women and immigrants, especially Muslim ones, came slowly, although with obviously disastrous results. He locked himself in his room for years playing <em>World of Warcraft</em>, isolating himself from his friends, before becoming enchanted with the writings of several right-wing authors who warned that Europe was at risk of being ruled by Islamic law. He fantasized about bombing a journalists' convention, about attacking the Labor party congress with a flamethrower. Soon, he'd acquire firearms and bomb-making materiel. The rest, of course, is tragic, unspeakable history.</p>   <div id="res400456577" class="bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col ">

   <p>Seierstad's recounting of the massacre is one of the most difficult things imaginable to read. By the time Breivik makes his way to Utøya, the reader has learned about the lives of many of the children on the island — some from the idyllic towns of northern Norway, some children of an immigrant family who escaped war-torn Kurdistan to make a new life for themselves. The descriptions of the murders are vivid, sickening, and heartbreaking.</p>   <p>Seierstad does an incredible job telling the whole story of the massacre and its aftermath, the deeply flawed response by law enforcement, and the families who lost children. Her writing, translated into English by Sarah Death, is both straightforward and compassionate. She doesn't spare the reader's feelings; it's a deeply painful book to experience.</p>   <p>And that's the point, of course. The question the world asked after the Norway massacre, as it does after every one of these, was "Why?" What happened to Breivik to make him do this? The urge to demand an explanation is a natural one. <em>One of Us</em> does not provide one, because there isn't one. Breivik, like so many of his fellow terrorists and murderers, is beyond explaining. It's a difficult conclusion to reach, but, as Seierstad knows, it's often a necessary one.</p>   <p><em>One of Us </em>is a masterpiece of journalism, a deeply painful chronicle of an inexplicable and horrifying attack that we'll likely never understand. It ends where it has to — with families still struggling to pick up the pieces of their lives. And with Breivik, in jail, pathetic and broken and whining about the justice system that put him away. In the end, it's the victims and their families that Seierstad cares about; they're the ones we'll remember, who we'll keep with us. Breivik, who wanted nothing more than for the world to know his name, becomes a footnote in his own story, a sad man who wanted to change the world, but instead strengthened the resolve of the people he terrorized — the least memorable character in this chapter of history, and in this brilliant, unforgettable book.</p>

        <paragraph num="1"><![CDATA[Like many Democrats, including the current president, Hillary Clinton has had difficulty maintaining a consistent position on international trade.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="2"><![CDATA[As President Obama seeks fast-track authority for a 12-country Pacific trade deal and Congress inches toward giving it to him, Clinton is hedging on a deal she once strongly backed.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="3"><![CDATA["She will be watching closely to see what is being done to crack down on currency manipulation, improve labor rights, protect the environment and health, promote transparency and open new opportunities for our small businesses to export overseas," an aide said in a statement Friday. Additionally, any trade deal would need to pass two tests for Clinton to support it, the campaign said — (1) Protect U.S. workers and raise wages and (2) strengthen national security.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="4"><![CDATA[Yet, previously as Secretary of State, Clinton called the Trans-Pacific Partnership the "gold standard in trade agreements." In her second memoir, Hard Choices, released in 2014, Clinton lauded the deal, saying it "would link markets throughout Asia and the Americas, lowering trade barriers while raising standards on labor, the environment, and intellectual property." She even said it was "important for American workers, who would benefit from competing on a more level playing field." She also called it "a strategic initiative that would strengthen the position of the United States in Asia."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="5"><![CDATA[That kind of apparent contradiction is especially glaring during the rollout of her second presidential campaign when she has been trying to pacify the liberal base with talk of constitutional amendments to get undisclosed money out of politics and a launch video that noted how "the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="6"><![CDATA[It also highlights Clinton's complicated history with trade. Her husband brokered and passed the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, in 1993.

        <paragraph num="17"><![CDATA[1996: "I think everybody is in favor of free and fair trade. I think NAFTA is proving its worth." (3/6/96, Clinton in New York at the Nicole Miller company at an event for the UNITE union.)]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="20"><![CDATA[SCHWAB: "In the same context, the fast-track trade legislation is very much at the top of the priorities of your husbands administration. What can you say also to the business community here to give the active and effective support for this legislative measure?"]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="21"><![CDATA[CLINTON: "Well, I would probably just echo what I already said, at the risk of being repetitive. There was a very effective business effort in the United States on behalf of NAFTA. There was a very limited and ineffective effort on behalf of fast track. I don't know all the reasons for that. Some of them suggested, but I have no basis for any first-hand knowledge or any analysis that I find convincing. The bottom line is, however, that no one in Congress felt any particular pressure, or demand, by any business interest about giving the President the authority that other presidents have had to negotiate trade agreements.]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="22"><![CDATA[Now again, I have to conclude that either American business doesn't care about opening markets around the world — but I find that very hard to believe — or they feel that their involvement in politics is something that they wish to minimize or steer clear of and don't want to become participants in any effort to pass such legislation, or some other reason that I have yet to understand. But the effect was the same. For whatever reason, the fact that the American business community made a very limited effort on behalf of the fast track, left the field completely clear to the rather unusual alliance between the right of the Republican party, which is isolationist, anti-American engagement, quite critical and not supportive of the United Nations, IMF or any multilateral group, and the left of the Democratic party that believes that trade authority, and trade agreements are not in the interests of American workers. So that alliance carried the day. Now when the President comes back to the Congress with a request for fast track authority I hope that American business voices will be heard."]]></paragraph>
        <paragraph num="23"><![CDATA["Having said that, I would add that there does need to be sensitivity to worker and environmental concerns in trade agreements going forward in the future. Certainly if they are going to be agreements that are negotiated with the United States government and require the consent of the United States Congress. So I think that there may be some good reason for business to engage early with labor and with political leadership in Congress and the Administration to try to hammer out a consensus about the kind of fast track authority and the sort of agreements that we want our President to be negotiating. But certainly that will not happen in the absence of some very stated and obvious business concern." (2/2/98, World Economic Forum remarks, Davos, Switzerland)]]></paragraph>

        <paragraph num="35"><![CDATA[2007:"NAFTA was inherited by the Clinton Administration. I believe in the general principles it represented, but what we have learned is that we have to drive a tougher bargain. Our market is the market that everybody wants to be in. We should quit giving it away so willy-nilly. I believe we need tougher enforcement of the trade agreements we already have. You look at the trade enforcement record between the Clinton Administration and the Bush Administration, the Clinton Administration brought more trade enforcement actions in one year than the Bush Administration brought in six years. For me, trade is who we are. We're traders. We want to be involved in the global economy, but not be played for suckers." (Time interview, 2/1/07)]]></paragraph>

This agreement makes meaningful progress on advancing workers' rights, and also levels the playing field for American workers. Most Peruvian goods already enter the U.S. duty free, but our exports to Peru have been subject to tariffs. However, I will oppose the pending trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama. The South Korean agreement does not create a level playing field for American carmakers. I am very concerned about the history of violence against trade unionists in Colombia. And as long as the head of Panama's National Assembly is a fugitive from justice in America, I cannot support that agreement. Accordingly, I will oppose the trade agreements with these countries."

This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.

        <paragraph num="46"><![CDATA[2014:"One of our most important tools for engaging with Vietnam was a proposed new trade agreement called the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which would link markets throughout Asia and the Americas, lowering trade barriers while raising standards on labor, the environment, and intellectual property. ...

You look at the trade enforcement record between the Clinton Administration and the Bush Administration, the Clinton Administration brought more trade enforcement actions in one year than the Bush Administration brought in six years.

The South Korean agreement does not create a level playing field for American carmakers. I am very concerned about the history of violence against trade unionists in Colombia. And as long as the head of Panama's National Assembly is a fugitive from justice in America, I cannot support that agreement. Accordingly, I will oppose the trade agreements with these countries."

   <p>Like many Democrats, including the current president, Hillary Clinton has had difficulty maintaining a consistent position on international trade.</p>   <p>As President Obama seeks fast-track authority for a 12-country Pacific trade deal and Congress inches toward giving it to him, Clinton is hedging on a deal she once strongly backed.</p>   <p>"She will be watching closely to see what is being done to crack down on currency manipulation, improve labor rights, protect the environment and health, promote transparency and open new opportunities for our small businesses to export overseas," an <a href="http://onpolitics.usatoday.com/2015/04/17/clinton-trade-fast-track-obama-gop/?utm_source=feedblitz&utm_medium=FeedBlitzRss&utm_campaign=usatodaycomwashington-topstories">aide said in a statement</a> Friday. Additionally, any trade deal would need to pass two tests for Clinton to support it, the campaign said — (1) Protect U.S. workers and raise wages and (2) strengthen national security.</p>   <p>Yet, previously as Secretary of State, Clinton called the Trans-Pacific Partnership the "gold standard in trade agreements." In her second memoir, <em>Hard Choices</em>, released in 2014, Clinton lauded the deal, saying it "would link markets throughout Asia and the Americas, lowering trade barriers while raising standards on labor, the environment, and intellectual property." She even said it was "important for American workers, who would benefit from competing on a more level playing field." She also called it "a strategic initiative that would strengthen the position of the United States in Asia."</p>   <p>That kind of apparent contradiction is especially glaring during the rollout of her second presidential campaign when she has been trying to pacify the liberal base with talk of constitutional amendments to get undisclosed money out of politics and a launch video that noted how "the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top."</p>   <p>It also highlights Clinton's complicated history with trade. Her husband brokered and passed the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, in 1993. The move irked labor unions, which are key to organizational efforts in Democratic campaigns. As first lady, in 1996, Clinton trumpeted NAFTA as "proving its worth."</p>   <p>She went to Davos, Switzerland, two years later, where she spoke at the World Economic Forum, and thanked businesses for lobbying for it. She also criticized them for not making a stronger push to give her husband fast-track authority to negotiate trade deals and limit congressional power to alter those deals. That's something being debated once again, as President Obama seeks a similar authority when it comes to TPP.</p>   <p>As Clinton campaigned for a U.S. Senate seat in New York, where Upstate manufacturing jobs had been lost, she backed away from strong support for NAFTA. She called it "flawed," adding that it needed to be fixed and noting, "[W]e didn't get everything we should have got out of it."</p>   <p>As a senator, she voted in favor of free-trade agreements with Singapore, Chile, Australia, Morocco and Oman. She also voiced support for deals with Jordan and Peru. But she also voted against the Central American Free Trade Agreement, or CAFTA.</p>   <div id="res401126165" class="bucketwrap image medium" previewTitle="A mailer sent by the Obama 2008 campaign against Hillary Clinton during the final stretch of the primary battle.">

Her positions on Colombia and South Korea changed, however, when she became secretary of state under President Obama, who ironically ran to Clinton's left in 2008 on trade.</p>   <p>In 2007, for example, Clinton called the South Korea deal "inherently unfair." Yet, four years later in Seoul, South Korea, as secretary of state, she said getting a South Korea deal done was a "priority for me, for President Obama and for the entire administration. We are determined to get it done, and I believe we will."</p>   <p>In April 2008, before the Pennsylvania primary, where she was trying to woo white-working class men, she said of a Colombia deal that she "will do everything I can to urge the Congress to reject the Colombia Free Trade Agreement."</p>   <p>But again, as secretary of state, she changed her tune.</p>   <p>"We think it's strongly in the interests of both Colombia and the United States," Clinton said two years later. "And I return very invigorated ... to begin a very intensive effort to try to obtain the votes to get the Free Trade Agreement finally ratified."</p>   <p>Here is a timeline of Clinton, in her own words, votes and events related to trade:</p>   <p><strong>1993: <br /></strong>NAFTA <a href="http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/nafta-signed-into-law">passes</a>, takes effect Jan. 1, 1994.</p>   <p><strong>1996: <br /></strong>"I think everybody is in favor of free and fair trade. I think NAFTA is proving its worth." (3/6/96, Clinton in New York at the Nicole Miller company at an event for the UNITE union.)</p>   <p><strong>1998 </strong>(in Davos at the World Economic Forum)<strong>:</strong></p>   <blockquote class="edTag"><div>   <p>SCHWAB: "In the same context, the fast-track trade legislation is very much at the top of the priorities of your husbands administration. What can you say also to the business community here to give the active and effective support for this legislative measure?"</p>   <p>CLINTON: "Well, I would probably just echo what I already said, at the risk of being repetitive. <strong>There was a very effective business effort in the United States on behalf of NAFTA. There was a very limited and ineffective effort on behalf of fast track. </strong>I don't know all the reasons for that. Some of them suggested, but I have no basis for any first-hand knowledge or any analysis that I find convincing. The bottom line is, however, that no one in Congress felt any particular pressure, or demand, by any business interest about giving the President the authority that other presidents have had to negotiate trade agreements.</p>   <p>Now again, I have to conclude that either American business doesn't care about opening markets around the world — but I find that very hard to believe — or they feel that their involvement in politics is something that they wish to minimize or steer clear of and don't want to become participants in any effort to pass such legislation, or some other reason that I have yet to understand. But the effect was the same. <strong>For whatever reason, the fact that the American business community made a very limited effort on behalf of the fast track, left the field completely clear to the rather unusual alliance between the right of the Republican party</strong>, which is isolationist, anti-American engagement, quite critical and not supportive of the United Nations, IMF or any multilateral group, <strong>and the left of the Democratic party that believes that trade authority, and trade agreements are not in the interests of American workers. So that alliance carried the day.</strong> Now when the President comes back to the Congress with a request for fast track authority I hope that American business voices will be heard."</p>   <p>"Having said that, I would add that there does need to be sensitivity to worker and environmental concerns in trade agreements going forward in the future. Certainly if they are going to be agreements that are negotiated with the United States government and require the consent of the United States Congress. So I think that there may be some good reason for business to engage early with labor and with political leadership in Congress and the Administration to try to hammer out a consensus about the kind of fast track authority and the sort of agreements that we want our President to be negotiating. But certainly that will not happen in the absence of some very stated and obvious business concern." (2/2/98, <a href="http://clinton2.nara.gov/WH/EOP/First_Lady/html/generalspeeches/1998/19980202.html%20'">World Economic Forum</a> remarks, Davos, Switzerland)</p>   </div></blockquote>   <p><strong>2000: <br /></strong>"What happened to NAFTA I think was we inherited an agreement that we didn't get everything we should have got out of it in my opinion. I think the NAFTA agreement was flawed. The problem is we have to go back and figure out how we are going to fix that." (3/26/00, Before Working Families Party, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081212012728/http:/www.hillaryclinton.com/news/release/view/?id=6175">per Clinton 2008 campaign</a>.)</p>   <p><strong>2003:<br /></strong>"Creating a free trade zone in North America — the largest free trade zone in the world — would expand U.S. exports, create jobs and ensure that our economy was reaping the benefits, not the burdens, of globalization. Although unpopular with labor unions, expanding trade opportunities was an important administration goal."

I believe in the general principles it represented, but what we have learned is that we have to drive a tougher bargain. Our market is the market that everybody wants to be in. We should quit giving it away so willy-nilly. I believe we need tougher enforcement of the trade agreements we already have. You look at the trade enforcement record between the Clinton Administration and the Bush Administration, the Clinton Administration brought more trade enforcement actions in one year than the Bush Administration brought in six years. For me, trade is who we are. We're traders. We want to be involved in the global economy, but not be played for suckers."

It has very strong labor and environmental protections. This agreement makes meaningful progress on advancing workers' rights, and also levels the playing field for American workers. Most Peruvian goods already enter the U.S. duty free, but our exports to Peru have been subject to tariffs. However, I will oppose the pending trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama. The South Korean agreement does not create a level playing field for American carmakers. I am very concerned about the history of violence against trade unionists in Colombia. And as long as the head of Panama's National Assembly is a fugitive from justice in America, I cannot support that agreement. Accordingly, I will oppose the trade agreements with these countries."

There was a Democratic primary debate the day it was voted on.)</p>   <p>"Look, NAFTA did not do what many had hoped, and so we do need to take a look at it and we do need to figure out how we're going to have trade relations that are smart, that give the American worker and the American consumer rights around the world. ... NAFTA was a mistake to the extent that it did not deliver on what we had hoped it would, and that's why I call for a trade timeout when I am president. I'm going to evaluate every trade agreement. ... we need the International Labor Organization and other mechanisms that will be there to enforce labor rights and environmental rights, and that's what I intend to do as president."

(Clinton campaign web site)</p>   <p>Clinton also called for a "new trade 'prosecutor'": "She will appoint a trade enforcement officer and double the enforcement staff at USTR. The current staff is too small to monitor and enforce the increasingly complex trade agreements." (Clinton campaign web site)</p>   <p>"You know, I have been a critic of NAFTA from the very beginning. I didn't have a public position on it, because I was part of the administration, but when I started running for the Senate, I have been a critic. I've said it was flawed. ... you don't have all the record because you can go back and look at what I've said consistently. And I haven't just said things; I have actually voted to toughen trade agreements, to try to put more teeth into our enforcement mechanisms. And I will continue to do so. ... I'm confident that as president, when I say we will opt out unless we renegotiate, we will be able to renegotiate."

This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field. And when negotiated, this agreement will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment."
